# Estimate energyscape and biomass consumption

To estimate the energyscape and prey biomass consumption, we first estimate the energyscape (spatialised energetic need of the population) of a marine predator species (either cetacean, seabirds, loggerhead turtles, sunfish, sharks, tunas or swordfish) from its abundance map and body mass distribution, as well as the sea surface temperature (for fish only). Second, we estimate the daily ration consumed for a given prey group by a single predator individual and the corresponding biomass consumed by the total population. This is done with `bio_cons_est()`, which runs a single estimation, drawing one sample from each provided distribution (body mass, abundance map, SST).



```{r examples-bio_cons_est}
result <- bio_cons_est(predator_group = "Procellariform",
             predator_name = "CALDIO", 
             prey_taxonomic_level = "Taxonomic_group", 
             prey_group = "Teleost",
             diet = diet, 
             assimilation_rate = 0.8,
             n_days = 30+31+31,
             predator_weight = weight, 
             abundance_map = species_abundance, 
             temperature_map = sst)

```

# Monte Carlo simulation

To obtain the final estimations, we embed this function into a Monte Carlo simulation which runs it how many times is required to obtain a reliable estimate. This number of simulation is set to 1000 by default but can be changed by the user. 



```{r examples-mc_simulation}
# test mc_simulation() with one prey level
CALDIO_result <- mc_simulation(predator_name = "CALDIO", 
                               predator_group = "Procellariform",
             map_coordinates = map_coords,
             prey_taxonomic_level = "Taxonomic_group", 
             diet = diet |> subset(Taxonomic_group == "Teleost"), 
             assimilation_rate = 0.8,
             n_days = 30+31+31,
             predator_weight = weight, 
             abundance_map = species_abundance, 
             temperature_map = sst)

# test mc_simulation() with 2 prey levels
CALDIO_result <- mc_simulation(predator_name = "CALDIO", 
                               predator_group = "Procellariform",
             map_coordinates = map_coords,
             prey_taxonomic_level = "Taxonomic_group", 
             diet = diet, 
             assimilation_rate = 0.8,
             n_days = 30+31+31,
             predator_weight = weight, 
             abundance_map = species_abundance, 
             temperature_map = sst)

# plot results
