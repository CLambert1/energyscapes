The goal of energyscapes is to estimate the field metabolic rate of
marine top predator species. Combining FMR with body mass distribution
data, abundance and SST through allometric relationships, the package
permits estimating the total energyscape for a species, that is the
spatialised energetic needs of the total population. Furthermore, this
energyscape can be used in combination with diet composition and prey
energy content information to estimate the total biomass of prey
necessary for a top predator population to sustain its needs.

This package was developed in the framework of the [European Horizon
2020 Program EcoScope project](https://ecoscopium.eu/), funded under the
grant agreement number 101000302.
